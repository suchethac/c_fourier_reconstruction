Image Reconstruction for Calibration Data of the COMING Project
===============================================================

This package and notebook uses the Papoulis-Gerchberg algorithm to reconstruct 2d images that had been affected by instrumental error. The error resulted in a faulty row of pixels in the image. Our motivation is to reconstruct this missing region.

To use the code, clone to a directory and copy the data in the directory "Data/".

This is still a very rough code. I havent done much documentation yet. I will add routines and comments when get time.
